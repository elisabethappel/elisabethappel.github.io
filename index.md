I am currently a data analytics developer at [Mathematica](https://mathematica.org/).

Prior to Mathematica, I worked at the NYU Furman Center where I contributed to research, data analysis and writing on range of urban-related policy issues including land use regulation, affordable housing finance, and the Community Reinvestment Act. 

I completed a masters degree in urban planning at the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service in 2023. I hold a bachelors degree in comparative literature and public policy, also from NYU.
